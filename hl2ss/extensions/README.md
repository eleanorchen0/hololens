# Optional Extensions

## client_cpp

C++ client library. Requires [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/releases/) and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html). You can get prebuilt FFmpeg binaries from https://github.com/BtbN/FFmpeg-Builds and OpenCV binaries from https://opencv.org/releases/. Device Portal MRC streamer requires [cpr](https://github.com/libcpr/cpr).

**Build**

Add `hl2ss.cpp`, `hl2ss.h`, `hl2ss_lnm.cpp`, `hl2ss_lnm.h`, `hl2ss_mt.cpp`, and `hl2ss_mt.h` to your C++ project.
Optionally, add  `hl2ss_dp.cpp` and `hl2ss_dp.h` for Device Portal MRC streamer support.
See `main.cpp` for examples.
The `tasks_[...].json` files are provided as a reference for building with `cl.exe` (Windows) and `g++` (Linux).

Alternatively, you can build `hl2ss_ulm.cpp` as a shared library (.dll, .so, ...) and include `hl2ss_ulm.h` in your C++ project.
See `main_ulm.cpp` for examples.
You can use the included Python scripts `build_ulm_[...].py` to build the shared library.
A prebuilt binary of the hl2ss_ulm shared library for Windows is included in [Releases](https://github.com/jdibenes/hl2ss/releases).

If you build `main.cpp` or `main_ulm.cpp` on Windows, you may need to copy the FFmpeg and OpenCV DLLs to the client_cpp folder.

## client_matlab

C++ MEX client library for MATLAB. It uses client_cpp as a base so it has the same requirements. See the scripts in the [viewer](https://github.com/jdibenes/hl2ss/tree/main/extensions/client_matlab/viewer) folder for examples. See `viewer_simulink.slx` for using the client library in Simulink.

**Build**

Run `hl2ss_build_[...].m` to generate the MEX file. Add the client_matlab folder to MATLAB path (you can type `pathtool` in the MATLAB command window to do this).

On Windows, after building the MEX file, copy the FFmpeg and OpenCV DLLs to the client_matlab folder.

## client_unity

C# wrapper for the hl2ss_ulm shared library. Has the same requirements as client_cpp. See the scripts in the Assets/Scripts/test folder for examples.

**Build**

Build the hl2ss_ulm shared library and copy it to the appropriate subfolder in Assets/Plugins. Also, copy the shared libraries for OpenCV and FFmpeg if necessary. Finally, build the Unity project.

## client_labview

Collection of LabVIEW VIs for streaming HoloLens 2 sensor data using the hl2ss_ulm shared library. Has the same requirements as client_cpp. See the `test_[...].vi` VIs for examples.

**Build**

Build the hl2ss_ulm shared library and copy it to the hl2ss_labview folder. Also, copy the shared libraries for OpenCV and FFmpeg if necessary.

## client_android

Android Native Library for streaming HoloLens 2 sensor data to Android apps. The included Android Studio project builds the hl2ss_ulm shared library as an .aar file, which is compatible with client_unity and its C# wrapper. It has the same requirements as client_cpp. For Android, you can get prebuilt FFmpeg binaries from https://github.com/arthenica/ffmpeg-kit and OpenCV binaries from https://opencv.org/releases/. A prebuilt binary of the hl2ss_ulm shared library is included in [Releases](https://github.com/jdibenes/hl2ss/releases).

**Build**

Open the project in Android Studio, set the paths to the FFmpeg and OpenCV headers and shared libraries in `CMakeLists.txt`, and build the hl2ss_ulm module. Import the output `hl2ss_ulm-release.aar` file into your Android project.

## client_python_mt

Multithreaded client extension for Python.

**Build**

Build the hl2ss_ulm shared library then run:

`python3 extension_hl2ss_ulm_stream_[...].py build`

After building copy the `hl2ss_ulm_stream.[...].pyd` (or `hl2ss_ulm_stream.[...].so`) file in the `build/lib.[...]` folder to the [viewer](https://github.com/jdibenes/hl2ss/tree/main/viewer) folder.
Also, copy the hl2ss_ulm shared library and the shared libraries for OpenCV and FFmpeg if necessary. On Windows, you might need to use `py` instead of `python3`.

## pyzdepth 

Zdepth wrapper for Python. Required to decompress RM Depth AHAT data configured with `hl2ss.DepthProfile.ZDEPTH`.

**Build**

`python3 extension_zdepth.py build`

After building copy the `pyzdepth.[...].pyd` (or `pyzdepth.[...].so`) file in the `build/lib.[...]` folder to the [viewer](https://github.com/jdibenes/hl2ss/tree/main/viewer) folder. On Windows, you might need to use `py` instead of `python3`.
